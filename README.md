# Detection of lines for ADAS Feature
The project is based on deep learning which detects the lane in road and suggest the user/ADAS of car to drive  as per the lane presence.

<ul>Automobiles are indispensible as per our day to day lives.We have to travel everyday  as per our daily routine or needs.Its been estimated that the number of automobiles is much more than the human population and the demand for it increases each year.</ul>

<ul>The code here is created based on the motive of autmoation of four vehicles at a faster and affordable pace.Automation could reduce the accidents caused by human errors/negilence.As a matter of fact the code been created to detect the lanes in roads and hepls the driver and car EMP to track those lanes and be in designated course.This is the intial phase of the lane detection_automation which keep a  record track of the car. </ul>

The image is converted to Gray scale for better gradient results and masking the other area and for detecting the Area of interest.
