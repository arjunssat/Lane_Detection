A ROI is a specific area within an image or video that is of interest and should be analyzed, while the rest of the image is ignored. 
In this case, the ROI is defined by a set of (x,y) coordinates that form a polygon. These coordinates are provided as a list of tuples inside a nested list.

The first tuple (200, height) represents the x and y coordinates of the top-left vertex of the ROI. The x-coordinate is set to 200 pixels from the left of the 
frame and the y-coordinate is set to the height of the frame, so that the ROI covers the entire height of the frame.

The second tuple (width/2, height/1.37) represents the x and y coordinates of the top-right vertex of the ROI. The x-coordinate is set to half of the width of the 
frame and the y-coordinate is set to the height of the frame divided by 1.37. This is used to define the angle of the ROI with respect to the road.

The third tuple (width-300, height) represents the x and y coordinates of the bottom-right vertex of the ROI. The x-coordinate is set to 300 pixels from the right 
of the frame and the y-coordinate is set to the height of the frame, so that the ROI covers the entire height of the frame.Finally, the np.int32 dtype is added to 
make sure that the vertex coordinates are integers and fillPoly can accept it.
It is used to apply a mask on the image to keep only the region of interest and discard the rest of the image.
